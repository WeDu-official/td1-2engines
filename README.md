# TD1INNER & TD2INNER
here you can find codes used for both engines/modules that [Time_diffz](https://pypi.org/project/timediffz) depends on

**td1inner** is pure python , while **td2inner** is python in terms of engine but engine's
math backing is done by fractionalstd2inner library a library I made based on cython and GMP
an implementation of python's built-in fractions only necessary functionalites that td2inner uses(Therefore Time_diffz](https://pypi.org/project/timediffz) uses)
